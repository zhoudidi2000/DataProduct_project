## Introduction

This is the project from Coursera Course--Developing Data Products.
A interactive web applications (apps) can bu built straight from R.
A Shiny apps is built using **Shiny** package.
I am sharing the server.R and ui.R code in this repo.

The application is also deployed on ShinyApps.io at [https://zhoudidi2000.shinyapps.io/ShinyTry/](https://zhoudidi2000.shinyapps.io/ShinyTry/).

## How to use
#### Method one

If you know R:

1. Put server.R and ui.R files together in a folder(you can name the folder yourself, eg. shinyTry). 
2. Install **Shiny** package by `install.packages("shiny")`, and load it using `library(shiny)`. 
3. Run the application using `runApp(<path/foldername>)`. 
4. You will see the application in a browser. Follow the instructions to use the application. 

#### Method two

The easiest way to turn your Shiny app into a web page is to use shinyapps.io, RStudioâ€™s hosting service for Shiny apps.
You can use the app at: [https://zhoudidi2000.shinyapps.io/ShinyTry/](https://zhoudidi2000.shinyapps.io/ShinyTry/).
